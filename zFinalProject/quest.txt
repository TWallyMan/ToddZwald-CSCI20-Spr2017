ADVENTURER, WE HAVE THE BEST ADVENTURE FOR YOU. THERE IS A CAVE AT THE BASE OF
MT. EXODUS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSEING US SOME TROUBLE. FOR WEEKS NOW THERE HAS BEEN 
REPORTS OF PEOPLE IN THE NEAR BY AREA GOING MISSING. WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO
AND CHECK WHAT THE DISTURBANCE IS. BUT BE WARNED, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER
ADVENTURERS THAT HAVE TRIED AND HAVE YET TO COME BACK. FOR YOUR TROUBLES THOUGH,
WE WOULD BE GLAD TO PAY YOU HANDSOMELY AND GIVE YOU A FULL SET OF ARMAMENTS 
UPON YOUR RETURN.
