YOUR STORY BEGINS DEEP IN THE MINES OF MIDDENHELM. HERE, EVERYONE IS FAMILY
AND EVERYONE IS TREATED WITH RISPECT. MAINLY DUE TO THE LOCAL GUARD, BUT AS 
LONG AS YOU FOLLOW THE RULES, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THE KING EVEN HAS
A LOCAL SPOT FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING TO ADVENTURE. HERE IS WHERE YOU MUST
DECIDE TO START YOUR STORY, GO TO THE MARKET FOR BUY YOUR NECESITIES OR GO TO
THE JOB BOARD AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN POSTED.
